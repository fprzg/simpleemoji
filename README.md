# Simple Emoji
Desktop emoji apps are clumsy and filled with adds, so I made this. Live on [simpleemoji.vercel.app](https://simpleemoji.vercel.app)

# TODO
- [X] For multi-emoji selection, modify the history only after the shift is released.
- [X] Set the "selected emojis" box floating so it doesn't push the rest of the app downwards (which is annoying).
- [ ] Multilingual support.
